# How to Clear the "See Attendant" on a Game King Poker Slot Machine

If you've been playing a Game King Poker Slot Machine and come across the "See Attendant" message, don't panic. This message can often occur due to minor issues that can be easily resolved. Here are some steps you can take to clear the "See Attendant" message on a Game King Poker Slot Machine:

## Step 1: Check for Jammed Bills

The "See Attendant" message can often appear due to jammed bills in the bill acceptor. First, check if there are any jammed bills in the bill acceptor or the cash box. If you find any, remove them carefully and try the machine again.

## Step 2: Check the Printer

If there are no jammed bills, the issue may be with the printer. Check if the paper roll in the printer is properly loaded and not jammed. If the roll is jammed, carefully remove it and load a new roll.

## Step 3: Restart the Machine

If the above steps don't resolve the issue, try restarting the machine. Turn off the machine, unplug it from the power source and wait for a few minutes before plugging it back in and turning it on.

## Step 4: Contact the Attendant

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be time to contact the attendant. The attendant will be able to troubleshoot the issue and resolve it. Be sure to inform them of the steps you've already taken to resolve the issue.

In conclusion, the "See Attendant" message on a Game King Poker Slot Machine can be frustrating, but it's not necessarily a serious issue. Try these simple steps to resolve the issue and get back to playing. Remember to always handle the machine with care and follow proper safety protocols.
