#  How Do They Do the Sinking Scene in Gambling Establishment Royal?

In Casino Royale, there is a scene where James Bond sinks the French envoy's yacht. How do they do the sinking scene in gambling establishment royale?

To sink a boat on cue, special effects crews use a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to pierce the hull of the vessel with steel cables. The cables are then attached to air-filled tanks that slowly fill up with water, sinking the boat.

The sinking of the French envoy's yacht in Casino Royale was done using an ROV operated by Theo Koper and his team from Dutch company Marine Technology Holland BV. To sink the boat, they first created two 10-foot-long (3 m), 2-inch-wide (5 cm) holes in its hull using an angle grinder. They then inserted four 75-foot-long (23 m), 1/2-inch-thick (1.3 cm) steel cables into the holes and connected them to air tanks on the surface. As the tanks filled with air, they forced water into the boat, sinking it within minutes.

#  The Making of the Sinking Scene in Casino Royale

Casino Royale is a 2006 British spy film, the 21st installment in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, Casino Royale is set at the beginning of Bond's career as a secret agent and features a scene where Bond forces Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to strip naked at gunpoint in order to obtain her money clip.

The scene proved controversial with some critics, who argued that it constituted a form of sexual assault. However, director Martin Campbell defended the scene, arguing that "It was necessary because he [Bond] has to establish his credentials with MI6 and he does that by humiliating someone." The nudity also helped attract female audiences to what is otherwise quite a violent film.

The stripping scene was shot in just two days and involved Eva Green having to physically wrestle with Daniel Craig. In an interview with Craig, he recalled that "She had to do all the stunts - she was throwing me around... It was a tough day's work." For her part, Green found the experience "exhausting but exhilarating" and praised Craig's intensity on set.

Despite its controversy, the stripping scene helped make Casino Royale one of the highest-grossing James Bond films of all time.
