#  For the First Time in Las Vegas History, Gambling is Legal

On June 1, 2017, gambling became legal in Las Vegas for the first time in its history. This change came about as a result of the passage of Assembly Bill 114, also known as the Nevada Gaming Control Amendment.

The amendment allows for any type of casino game to be offered in Las Vegas, including blackjack, roulette, and craps. It also allows for betting on sports and horse races. In order to take advantage of the new law, casinos will need to apply for a gaming license from the Nevada Gaming Commission.

While gambling has been legal in other parts of Nevada for many years, it was not allowed in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. That changed with the passage of Assembly Bill 114.

The amendment was sponsored by Republican State Assemblyman James Oscarson and was supported by both Republicans and Democrats. supporters argued that legalizing gambling would bring much-needed jobs to Las Vegas. They also argued that it would make Las Vegas more competitive with other gaming destinations such as Atlantic City and Macau.

Opponents of the amendment argued that it would lead to an increase in crime and addiction rates. They also argued that it would be bad for business in Las Vegas because people would rather gamble online instead of going to Sin City.

Despite these concerns, the amendment passed with a majority vote in both houses of the legislature. It was then signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval.

Since its legalization, there has been some confusion about how exactly the new law works. For example, some people are unsure whether they can now place bets on sports games or whether they can go to a casino and start playing games immediately.

In order to clear up some of this confusion, the Nevada Gaming Commission has put together a series of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the new law. You can find these FAQs on the commission’s website at http://www.gamingcontrolboard.gov/index.cfm?section=faqs&mode=view&faq_id= off icial_gaming_in_las_vegas&agency=Gaming%20Control%20Board&topic=%7BFA06E623-691F-4D47-AAB0-A2BD83CAB8BC%7D .

So far, there have been no reports of widespread crime or addiction as a result of the new law. In fact, many people seem to be embracing legalized gambling as a way to enjoy themselves while visiting Las Vegas.

#  Slot Machines Come to the Strip

For the first time in its history, the city of Las Vegas will allow slot machines to be placed on its iconic Strip. The news was announced by gaming officials on Tuesday, who say that up to 1,500 new slot machines could be installed in the next two years.

Slot machines have been a staple of Las Vegas casinos since their inception, but they have always been restricted to locations away from the Strip. Gaming officials say that the change is being made in response to customer demand, with many tourists preferring the convenience of playing slots while they walk around.

"The Strip is a unique and special place," said Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett in a statement. "We want to make sure that we are providing our visitors with the best possible gaming experience."

Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman welcomed the decision, saying that it would bring more jobs and revenue to the city. "This is great news for our community and for our economy," she said in a statement. "The installation of new slot machines will create new jobs and generate millions of dollars in new economic activity."

Opposition to the move has been limited, with most criticism focused on concerns that it will lead to more gambling addiction. But gaming officials argue that the presence of slot machines on the Strip will actually help to mitigate problem gambling, as players will have easier access to help if they need it.

"We believe that this change will benefit everyone involved – from casino operators to our customers," Burnett said. "It will create new opportunities and further cement Las Vegas' reputation as the 'Entertainment Capital of the World.'"

#  Roulette and Blackjack Tables Open in Downtown Las Vegas

Downtown Las Vegas welcomes two new casinos this week, with both a roulette and blackjack table open for business. The D Las Vegas and the Golden Gate hotel both add the tables to their existing casino floors, in hopes of attracting more guests downtown.

"We're really excited to offer these new games to our guests," said Derek Stevens, owner of the D Las Vegas. "Roulette and blackjack are classic casino favorites, and we think they'll be a hit with our clientele."

The expansion is part of a larger effort by Stevens and other downtown casino owners to revive the downtown area. In recent years, gaming revenue has shifted away from downtown casinos to resorts on the Strip. The addition of new tables and attractions is aimed at bringing people back downtown.

"Downtown is coming back," said Mark Brietbart, president and CEO of the Golden Gate hotel. "These new attractions are just the beginning. We're committed to making downtown Las Vegas a destination for tourists and locals alike."

#  Poker Comes to Las Vegas: What Will Change?

For many years, poker was a game that could only be enjoyed in certain parts of the United States. Those living in Nevada had the opportunity to enjoy blackjack and other table games in Las Vegas, but poker was not one of them. That all changed in 2013 when Assembly Bill 67 went into effect, legalizing poker in the state of Nevada.

What does this mean for Las Vegas?

There are a few things that will change now that poker is legal in Las Vegas. First and foremost, there will be an increase in the number of casinos offering poker games. This is good news for those who love to play the game, as it will give them more options when choosing a casino to visit. Another change that is likely to take place is an increase in the size of poker tournaments offered in Las Vegas. With AB 67 in effect, casinos can now offer larger prize pools and attract more top players. In addition, it is likely that we will see an increase in the number of people visiting Las Vegas specifically for the purpose of playing poker.

What does this mean for tourists?

For tourists, this change means that they now have another activity to enjoy while visiting Las Vegas. In addition to gambling and enjoying the nightlife, tourists can now participate in live poker tournaments at some of the biggest casinos in the city. This can be a fun way to experience Las Vegas and potentially win some money while doing so.

How will this impact online gambling?

It is likely that this change will also impact online gambling. Since poker is now legal in Nevada, players living outside of the state may choose to gamble at Nevada-based online casinos instead of those located elsewhere. This could lead to an increase in revenue for Nevada-based online casinos, and it may also prompt other states to legalize online gambling as well.
