#  WHY VIKKI AND VANCE ARE HEADING TO BELIZE

After a month of dating, Vikki and Vance have decided that they need some time away from each other. Vikki is heading to Belize for the week, and Vance is going to stay in Los Angeles.

They both know that this isn't really a break-up, but they also know that it will give them some time to miss each other. They're excited to see what happens when they come back together.

Vikki is packing her bags and getting ready to head to the airport when she gets a text from Vance.

"I'm so sorry, Vikki. I didn't want to do this, but I think it's for the best."

Vikki's heart sinks as she reads the text. She knows that this can only mean one thing - Vance has decided to break up with her.

She starts to cry as she rocks back and forth on her bed. She knows that she'll never be able to see him again, and that she'll always regret not fighting harder for him.

Meanwhile, Vance is in his apartment, also crying his eyes out. He knows that he made the right decision, but he still feels like he's losing the love of his life. He hopes that they can be happy someday, even if they're not together anymore.
