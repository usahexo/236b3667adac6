#  Poker Empire777 - How Different Hands Play Out

There are a lot of different ways a hand of poker can play out, and no two are ever exactly the same. In this article, we're going to take a look at how some of the more common hands might play out.

Straight Flush

A straight flush is the best possible hand you can get in poker, and it's also quite rare. If you are lucky enough to be holding one, you should bet big and hope to win the entire pot.

Four of a Kind

A four of a kind is an extremely strong hand, and is usually enough to win the pot outright. Again, if you're lucky enough to have this hand, be sure to bet big and try to scare off any competition.

Full House

A full house is a very strong hand, but it's not quite as good as a four of a kind. Still, it's usually enough to win smaller pots outright, so be sure to bet aggressively if you have one.

Flush

A flush is a solid hand that can often take down smaller pots. If there aren't any other strong hands in play, be sure to bet aggressively in order to secure the win.

Straight

A straight is not as good as a flush or a full house, but it's still a very strong hand. If you manage to make your way all the way to the end of the betting round with this hand, be sure to bet big in order to ensure victory.

#  Poker Empire777 - How to Calculate Outs and Winning Chances

There are a variety of different Poker variants to enjoy, each with their own subtleties and strategies. However, the underlying principles of Poker are the same, no matter what game you’re playing. In this article, we’re going to focus on how to calculate your chances of winning a particular hand, by using something called outs.

An out is essentially a card that will help you win the pot. For example, if you’re holding two hearts and the board shows two hearts, one spade and one club, then you have three out of the four possible hearts left in the deck to improve your hand. This means that your chances of making a flush are about 25 percent (3/(4*52)) - You can use a Poker Odds Calculator to work out precise percentages for any given scenario.

The best way to maximise your chances of winning is to figure out which cards will help you the most, and then play accordingly. For instance, if there are only two hearts left in the deck and you need one to make a flush, then it might be worth playing conservatively and folding unless you get dealt a starting hand like Ace-King or King-Queen (which would give you two chances of making your flush).

However, if there are three hearts left in the deck and you need two to make a flush, then it might be worth going all in with any heart that you manage to get dealt. This is because your chances of hitting at least one more heart are significantly higher than if there were only two hearts remaining.

Outs aren’t just useful for calculating your chances of winning a particular hand though - They can also be used for deciding when to fold. For example, if you’re holding an Ace-Queen suited combination and the flop comes down as 2-3-4 rainbow (i.e. no suits), then you have four potential outs - The Ace and Queen of any other suit. If an Ace or Queen appears on either the turn or river card, then you will have either made two pair or trips (depending on whether or not an opponent also has an Ace or Queen).

If there are six cards remaining that could improve your hand (Ace through 6), and only two specific cards would give you a winning hand (Ace-King), then it’s usually correct to fold unless the pot is already substantial. This is because the odds of hitting your desired card(s) are relatively low - You would have around a 16 percent chance of hitting one of them (6/(46*2)).

#  Poker Empire777 - Understanding Odds and Probability 

If you are looking to play poker for profit, it is important to have a basic understanding of the odds and probability. In this article, we will discuss the basics of odds and probability, and how they can help you make better decisions at the poker table.

Odds are a measure of how likely it is that something will happen, while probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. In poker, we use odds to determine whether or not it is profitable to call or fold based on the strength of our hand.

For example, let's say you are holding Ac-Jc on the flop. The flop consists of two hearts and a club, giving you an open-ended straight draw. Your opponent has bet $10 into a $10 pot. Assuming there are no other players in the hand, what are your odds of making your straight?

There are ten cards remaining that can help you make your straight (eight hearts and two clubs), so your odds of making your straight are 10:8, or 1.25:1. This means that if you call your opponent's bet, your expectation is to lose $1.25 for every $1 you gamble. Therefore, in this situation it would usually be unprofitable to call your opponent's bet.

Now let's say instead that you are holding Kh-Qh on the flop. The flop consists of two hearts and a club, giving you an open-ended straight draw. Your opponent has bet $10 into a $10 pot. Assuming there are no other players in the hand, what are your odds of making your straight?

There are thirteen cards remaining that can help you make your straight (eleven hearts and two clubs), so your odds of making your straight are 13:8, or 1.625:1. This means that if you call your opponent's bet, your expectation is to lose $1.625 for every $1 you gamble. Therefore, in this situation it would usually be profitable to call your opponent's bet.

As you can see, understanding odds and probability can help you make better decisions at the poker table - especially when facing bets from opponents

#  Poker Empire 777- Advanced Texas Hold'em Strategies 

There are a lot of different poker variants, but few are as popular as Texas Hold'em. The game is so popular that there are entire tournaments and leagues dedicated to it. And if you want to be a successful player in these tournaments, you need to have a strong grasp of the Advanced Texas Hold'em Strategies.

In this article, we're going to discuss several of these strategies. But first, let's start with the basics. In Texas Hold'em, the object of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards. The player who has the best hand at the end of the hand wins the pot.

There are a lot of different combinations that can make up a winning hand, but here are some of the most common: 

One Pair: This is simply two cards of the same rank. 
Two Pair: This is two different pairs of cards. 
Three of a Kind: This is three cards of the same rank. 
Straight: This is five consecutive cards of any suit. 
Flush: This is five cards of the same suit. 
Full House: This is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. 
Four of a Kind: This is four cards of the same rank. 
Straight Flush: This is five consecutive cards all from the same suit.


Now that you know some basic hands, let's move on to some Advanced Texas Hold'em Strategies.

1) Play more hands: One way to improve your chances of winning is by playing more hands. If you only play hands that you're absolutely certain you have a winning hand, then you'll be missing out on a lot of potential pots. Instead, try playing more marginal hands and see what happens. You may get lucky and win more pots this way.
2) Betting : Another important aspect of Texas Hold'em strategy is betting correctly. When it comes time to bet, you need to figure out how much money to put in based on your chances of winning the hand and your opponent's chances as well. You also want to try and bluff your opponents occasionally when you don't have the best hand – this can throw them off and help you win some extra chips.

#  Poker Empire 777- How to Play Pot-Limit Omaha

1. In Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO), each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a betting round. After the first betting round, three cards are turned face up (the "flop") and followed by another betting round. After the flop, a fourth card is turned face up (the "turn") and a final betting round takes place. Finally, the fifth and final card (the "river") is revealed, completing the hand.

2. At showdown, the best hand of five cards using any combination of the player's four cards and the five community cards wins the pot. In PLO, unlike Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hi-Lo Split, all players compete for the same pot not just the best hand. The ranking of hands is as follows:

High Card: If nobody has any of the above hands, then the highest card wins; i.e., Ace high beats king high, which beats jack high, etc.

One Pair: Two cards of the same rank as well as three other unrelated cards. For example, if someone held two Kings and two sixes their hand would be called "King-Six".

Two Pair: Two different pairs as well as one other unrelated card. For example, if someone had two queens and two fours their hand would be called "Queen-Four".

Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank as well as two other unrelated cards. For example, if someone had three threes and two sevens their hand would be called "Threes-Sevens".

Straight: Five consecutive rankedcards regardless of suit (eg 2H 3D 4C 5D 6S is a straight). Aces can be high or low so an ace can come either before 2 or after 5 in this example). Straights with an ace as either high or low are called "Aces Up" straights. Straights that do not include an ace are called "Normal Straights". In case of ties - for example if more than one player has a straight - the pot is split evenly between these players).

Flush: All five cards are of the same suit (eg 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C is a flush). When there is more than one flush at showdown, the highest ranking card within that flush determines who wins (aces are high). So for example if someone had Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten of spades whereas someone else had Ace-Queen-King-Jack-Ten of clubs then the first player would win since their ace is higher than the queen in second player's flush). In case of ties - for example if more than one player has a flush -the pot is split evenly between these players).

Full House: This occurs when someone has three cards of one rank (for example three sixes) as well as two cards of another rank (for example two kings), such that they have sixes full of kings. When there is more than one full house at showdown, the highest ranking full house determines who wins. So for example if somebody had Sixes full of Aces and somebody else had Kings full of Aces then the first player would win since their sixes are higher than kings in second player's full house). In case of ties - for example if more than one player has a full house -the pot is split evenly between these players).
