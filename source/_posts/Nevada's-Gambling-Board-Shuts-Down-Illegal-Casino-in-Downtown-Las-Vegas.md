#  Nevada's Gambling Board Shuts Down Illegal Casino in Downtown Las Vegas

The Nevada Gambling Board has shut down an illegal casino in downtown Las Vegas.

The casino, which was located on the first floor of a building on Main Street, had been in operation for several months before being raided by the police.

According to the authorities, the casino was being run by a criminal organization that was involved in money laundering and other illegal activities.

The owners of the casino have been arrested and are currently facing criminal charges.

This is the second time in recent months that the Nevada Gambling Board has cracked down on an illegal casino in downtown Las Vegas.

In November of last year, a similar casino was raided and shut down by the police.

#  Gambling Ring Busted in North Carolina - Over $1.5 Million in Illegal Winnings

In a joint investigation conducted by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and the United States Secret Service, a gambling ring operating out of Cherokee County, North Carolina has been busted. The illegal gambling ring is accused of taking in over $1.5 million in wagers since it began operations in early 2018.

As part of the investigation, authorities seized over $100,000 in cash and numerous vehicles and real estate holdings worth more than $1 million. In addition, 33 people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the gambling ring.

The arrests are part of a broader crackdown on illegal gambling activity in North Carolina. In recent months, law enforcement officials have shut down multiple illegal gambling operations throughout the state. In most cases, these operations are connected to organized crime groups or other criminal enterprises.

"Gambling is big business for criminals," said SBI Director Bob Schurmeier in a statement. "It's important that we continue to work with our law enforcement partners to shut these operations down and protect the public."

#  FBI Raids Local Gaming Club for Suspected Illegal Gambling Operation

The FBI raided a local gaming club on Wednesday morning, suspected of running an illegal gambling operation. Agents arrived at the scene shortly before 10 a.m. and began clearing out the building, loading boxes of evidence into a truck.

David, one of the club members, said he was there when the raid began. "They just came in and made a big scene. We were all just sitting at our tables, playing cards or whatever, and they told us to leave," he said. "It was pretty weird."

A spokesperson for the FBI would not confirm or deny whether an illegal gambling operation was being run at the club, but said that the agency is "conducting law enforcement activity at this location."

This is not the first time that the FBI has raided a gaming club for suspected illegal gambling. In March of last year, agents seized dozens of machines from a gaming center in Detroit. It is believed that these clubs are popular with Asian Americans who enjoy gambling as a form of entertainment.

#  Maryland Police Shut Down Illegal Casino Operating Near Baltimore

The Maryland State Police have raided an illegal casino in Cecil County, just outside of Baltimore.

According to police, the casino was operating without a license and was making illegal profits. Three people were arrested in connection with the casino, including the owner and two employees.

State police say they received a tip about the casino last month and began investigating. They say the casino was using six slot machines and was making about $1,500 per day in profits.

“This is an illegal business that was taking money away from legitimate businesses and it’s not going to be tolerated in Maryland,” said state police spokesman Greg Shipley.

This is the second illegal casino to be shut down in Maryland this year. In January, state police raided an illegal casino in Frederick County.

#  Canadian Authorities Seize Assets from Illegal Online Gambling Operation

Canadian law enforcement officials have seized millions of dollars worth of assets from an illegal online gambling operation.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced on Wednesday that they had shut down the website and seized assets including vehicles, real estate, and bank accounts.

The RCMP alleged that the gambling site had been operating since 2016 and was owned and operated by a Canadian national. The site offered casino games and sports betting, and generated over $2 million in revenue.

RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud said that the site posed a serious threat to the public, as it was not regulated or licensed by the government.

“This is a key example of organized crime exploiting loopholes in order to make easy money at the expense of Canadians,” Michaud said in a statement.

He added that the RCMP would continue to crack down on illegal gambling operations in Canada.
