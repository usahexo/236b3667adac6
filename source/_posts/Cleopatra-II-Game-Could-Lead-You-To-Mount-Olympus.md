Mount Olympus, located in the north-central part of Greece, is said to be the home of the gods and goddesses. According to mythology, Mount Olympus is where Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, Hades, and other deities lived.

The highest peak of Mount Olympus reaches an elevation of 9,570 feet and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. According to legend, although mortals were not allowed to set foot on Mount Olympus, there were a few exceptions.

One such exception was Heracles (better known as Hercules), who was tasked with cleaning up the mountain by Zeus. Another was Orpheus, who was able to visit the gods after he charmed them with his music.
