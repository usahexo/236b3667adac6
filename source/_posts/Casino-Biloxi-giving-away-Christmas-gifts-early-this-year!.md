#  Casino Biloxi giving away Christmas gifts early this year!

In an effort to spread some extra holiday cheer, Biloxi’s popular casino is giving away Christmas gifts a few weeks early this year. Players can earn one gift card for every $10 they wager on slots, table games and poker from now until December 21. There are over 250 different gift cards to choose from, including Amazon, Walmart and Target.

This promotion is open to everyone, not just casino members. And there’s no limit to how many gift cards players can earn. “We just wanted to do something special for our guests this Christmas,” said casino spokesperson Andrew White. “Hopefully this will put everyone in the holiday spirit!”

Biloxi’s Casino is one of the most popular in the state of Mississippi. It offers a wide range of gaming options, including blackjack, craps, roulette and slots.
