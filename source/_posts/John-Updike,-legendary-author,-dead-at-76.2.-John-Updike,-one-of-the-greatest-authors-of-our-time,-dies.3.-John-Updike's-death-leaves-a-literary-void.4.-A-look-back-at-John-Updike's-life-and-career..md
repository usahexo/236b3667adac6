John Updike, one of the most prolific and acclaimed American authors of the 20th century, has died at age 76.2

Updike, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1982 for his novel "Rabbit Is Rich," died of cancer at his home in Massachusetts, according to a statement from his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.3

"He was a brilliantly talented writer whose expansive and imaginative work will live on for generations," Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said.4

A versatile writer whose work ranged from the humorous Rabbit Angstrom series to more serious novels such as "The Centaur" and "Beloved," Updike was also one of the most influential literary critics of his generation.5

Raised in Shillington, Pennsylvania, Updike published his first short story while still a student at Harvard and went on to become one of the most honored authors of his time.6

In addition to the Pulitzer, he won two National Book Awards, two National Magazine Awards and a PEN/Faulkner Award.7

Updike is survived by his wife, Tokofsky; their four children; and nine grandchildren.8
