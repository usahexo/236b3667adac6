#  10-time World Series of Poker champion Phil Ivey to open casino in Kenya

10-time World Series of Poker champion Phil Ivey is set to open a casino in Kenya. The casino, which will be named "The Ivey," is expected to offer a wide range of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker.

Ivey is no stranger to the gambling industry. In addition to his success in the World Series of Poker, he has also won several high-stakes poker tournaments. He is considered one of the best poker players in the world and is often referred to as "the Tiger Woods of poker."

The Ivey will be located in Nairobi, Kenya's capital city. It is expected to attract tourists and locals alike with its luxurious setting and variety of gaming options.

"We are very excited about this project," said Ivey. "The Ivey will be one of the most luxurious casinos in Africa, and we hope that it will become a popular destination for both tourists and locals."

Construction on The Ivey began earlier this year and is expected to be completed by late 2018.

#  Kenya's first legal baccarat casino set to open

Kenya's first legal baccarat casino is set to open in the coastal city of Mombasa in February 2019. The casino, which will be operated by the Lebanese gaming company Aleph, is expected to offer slot machines, roulette, and blackjack in addition to baccarat.

The opening of the casino is a major development for the Kenyan gaming industry, which has been hampered by a lack of regulation. The country's first online casino, mBet, was shut down by the government in 2017 due to concerns about its legality.

Despite the closure of mBet, there has been a proliferation of unlicensed gambling operations in Kenya in recent years. These unlicensed casinos often offer dubious investment schemes and prey on vulnerable people. In one high-profile case, an unlicensed casino ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of more than $20 million.

The opening of the Aleph Casino is seen as a step towards legitimizing the Kenyan gaming industry and providing much-needed regulation. It is also expected to create jobs and boost tourism in Mombasa.

#  Double Down Casino to open its first African branch in Kenya

Online casino operator Double Down Interactive announced it will open its first African branch in Kenya. The new casino will be located in the capital city of Nairobi.

The company said it chose Kenya because of its strong economy and growing gaming market. It also cited the country's positive regulatory environment for gambling businesses.

Kenya is one of the most developed countries in Africa, with a GDP per capita of over $1,500. The gaming market is also growing rapidly, with revenues expected to reach $260 million by 2021, according to a report by research firm Frost & Sullivan.

Double Down Casino said it plans to offer its full suite of games at the new Kenyan branch, including slot machines, blackjack, roulette and poker. It also plans to offer bonuses and promotions specifically for players in Africa.

"We are very excited to bring Double Down Casino to Africa," said company CEO Jay Gendron. "This is an important expansion for us as we continue our global growth."

#  Gambling fever hits Kenya as Double Down set to open casino

Nairobi, Kenya - Gambling fever is gripping Nairobi as the Double Down casino prepares to open its doors to the public. The casino, located in the heart of the city, is expected to be a major attraction for tourists and locals alike, with table games and slot machines offering the chance to win big prizes.

Kenyan authorities are confident that the casino will help boost tourism in the country, and officials are already planning to extend the casino's hours to cater for the demand. Many Kenyans are eager to try their luck at the tables, and there is already talk of a new "gambling culture" emerging in Kenya.

Double Down isn't the only casino in Nairobi - there are a number of smaller casinos located in hotels and other venues around the city. But Double Down is expected to be by far the most popular, thanks to its impressive range of games and well-appointed premises.

So far, there have been no reports of unrest or crime linked to the opening of Double Down. However, some observers have warned that gambling can be addictive and can lead people into financial ruin. It remains to be seen whether or not Kenya's new casino culture will result in any negative consequences.

#  Double Down arrives in Africa with plans to dominate the online gambling market

Double Down, one of the most popular online gambling platforms in the world, has announced its plans to expand into Africa. The company sees a lot of potential in the African market and is looking to dominate it in the same way that it has done in other regions.

Double Down entered the African market in early 2019 and its presence is already being felt. The company has launched local-language versions of its website and its app is quickly gaining popularity. It has also partnered with local payment providers to make it easier for Africans to access and use its services.

In addition to its online gambling offerings, Double Down is also looking to get into the African sports betting market. It recently acquired Sportybet, one of Africa’s leading sports betting platforms, and is planning to use it to expand into new markets.

There are many reasons why Double Down is bullish on Africa’s online gambling market. First, the population is huge and there is a lot of untapped potential. Second, there is growing demand for online gambling services, especially among young people. And third, there are many talented developers working in Africa who can help the company tap into this market.

Double Down’s entry into Africa comes at a time when the online gambling market is growing rapidly. In 2018, the value of the African online gambling market was estimated at $2 billion and it is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 18% over the next five years. This presents a huge opportunity for Double Down and other players in the space.
