#  Another Indian Tribe Seeks to Control Viejas Casino

The Viejas Indian tribe, located near San Diego, California, is seeking to control the nearby Viejas casino. The tribe has already successfully negotiated a compact with the state of California that would allow it to own and operate the casino.

The move is being opposed by the Sycuan Indian tribe, which also has a casino in the area. The Sycuan tribe has already filed a lawsuit claiming that the Viejas tribe does not have jurisdiction over the casino.

The Viejas tribe has been in operation since 1935, when it was established as a reservation for members of the Kumeyaay Nation. The tribe currently has about 1,500 members. The Viejas casino is one of the largest in California, with more than 2,000 slot machines and 50 table games.

The Sycuan Indian tribe has about 3,000 members and operates the Sycuan Casino & Resort, which has more than 2,800 slot machines and 65 table games.

#  Viejas Casino Sold to New Indian Tribe Owner

The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians has announced that it has agreed to sell its casino and resort complex to the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation for $360 million.

The Viejas Casino, which is located in Alpine, California, is one of the largest in the state, with 2,000 slot machines and over 60 table games. It also features a hotel, a spa, and several restaurants.

The Sycuan Band is a federally recognized Indian tribe that has 2,600 members. It operates two casinos in San Diego County, California.

The sale is still subject to approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but it is expected to be finalized later this year.

The Viejas Band said that it was selling the casino because it wanted to focus on its other businesses, which include a cattle ranching operation and a construction company.

In a statement, the Viejas Band's chairman said: "This was not an easy decision but we believe it is the best one for our tribe. The Sycuan Band is well positioned to take over operations of the casino and we are confident that they will continue to provide our guests with a world-class gaming experience."

The Sycuan Band said that it planned to invest "substantial resources" into upgrading the Viejas Casino's amenities. It also pledged to keep all of the casino's employees employed.

#  Viejas Casino's Future Uncertain as Tribes Invest in New Casinos

The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians is facing an uncertain future as two other tribes in the state open new casinos. The Viejas casino, located in Alpine, has been a major source of revenue for the tribe for over two decades, but with new casinos popping up all around them, their profits are dwindling.

The Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation and the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians both opened new casinos in the past year, putting pressure on Viejas to keep up. The Viejas casino currently brings in about $250 million a year, but that number is expected to drop to $160 million by 2020.

To make up for the lost revenue, the tribe is considering expanding its casino resort and adding more hotel rooms, restaurants, and other amenities. They're also looking into expanding their gaming operations into other states.

It's unclear what will happen to the Viejas casino if these plans don't pan out, but one thing is for sure: the competition is fierce and they're going to have to work hard to stay afloat.

#  Viejas Casino Allegedly in Financial Trouble

The Viejas Casino in Alpine, California is in alleged financial trouble, according to a report from the <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/viejas-casino-troubled-alpine-510162061.html">NBC San Diego</a> affiliate station. The Viejas Tribe, which owns the casino, has been trying to renegotiate its debt with creditors for months, but has reportedly been unsuccessful so far. 

The casino resort is said to owe around $288 million, which is a large amount even by casino standards. The Viejas Tribe has been attempting to restructure its debt so that it can keep the casino open, but if a deal cannot be reached soon then the resort may have to close its doors. This could be a major blow to the local economy, as the Viejas Casino is one of the largest employers in the area.

According to NBC San Diego, representatives for the casino refused to comment on the matter. However, they did issue a statement saying that they are working hard to reach an agreement with their creditors and that they remain confident in their ability to do so.
