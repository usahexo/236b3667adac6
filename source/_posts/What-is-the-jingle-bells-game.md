#  What is the jingle bells game?

The jingle bells game is a Christmas-themed party game in which players shake bells to create a melody. It is often played as a variation of the Simon Says game.

To play, one player starts by shaking a bell and then saying, "Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg." The next player then repeats that phrase and adds another line, such as "Wonder Woman tastes good," followed by the next player repeating all of the lines in order. If a player makes a mistake or cannot remember the words, they are out of the game. The last player to successfully recite all of the lines is the winner.

The jingle bells game can also be played with various other objects that make noise, such as maracas or clapping hands.
