#  Rowan Atkinson to Star in a Remake of The Telephone

Rowan Atkinson, the popular English actor and comedian, will reportedly star in a remake of the Italian comedy film The Telephone. Atkinson is best known for his work on the BBC sitcom Mr. Bean and has also starred in several films over the years.

The original film, released in 1988, was written and directed by Nanni Moretti and follows the story of a man who attempts to call his estranged wife but keeps getting disconnected due to various problems with the phone line. Atkinson will play the lead role in the remake, which is set to begin filming next year.

This will be Atkinson's first time headlining a feature-length comedy film since 2003's Johnny English. He has since appeared in several smaller films and TV roles, but this will be his return to big-screen comedy. The Telephone remake is being produced by Working Title Films, the same studio behind 2016's smash hit Bridget Jones's Baby.

Atkinson is no stranger to remakes, having previously starred in a reboot of Mr. Bean in 2007. That film was a box office success and spawned two sequels, both of which also starred Atkinson. It's unclear at this point whether The Telephone remake will be a standalone film or if it will be connected to the Mr. Bean franchise in some way.

Remakes of popular comedies are becoming increasingly common in Hollywood, with films like 2017's Baywatch and 2009's Funny People receiving mixed reviews from audiences and critics alike. However, given Atkinson's proven track record as a comedic actor, The Telephone remake is likely to be one of the more successful entries in this recent trend.

#  Rowan Atkinson Invents New Form of Entertainment

British comedy actor Rowan Atkinson has announced a new form of entertainment that he has invented, called "mashups". A mashup is a combination of two or more different sources of audio or video, usually created by digitally combining the disparate elements into one file.

Atkinson himself debuted his first mashup on YouTube, which was a combination of him reading passages from the Bible and performing traditional Scottish folk songs. He says that the aim of mashups is to "amuse and entertain" audiences, and that he plans to release a series of them in the near future.

So far, Atkinson's mashups have been received with mixed reactions. Some viewers have praised him for his creativity and humor, while others have found them confusing and difficult to follow. However, it seems that Atkinson is determined to stick with this new form of entertainment, and we can only wait and see what he comes up with next.

#  Rowan Atkinson to Start His Own TV Network

Rowan Atkinson, best known for his roles in the "Blackadder" series and Mr. Bean, is set to launch his own TV network. The as-yet-unnamed network will be an independent channel with a focus on comedy programming.

Atkinson has been largely absent from television since his 2011 one-man show "Not Just a Pretty Face". He is now planning to return with a new network that will showcase original programming and classic comedy films.

The new channel has already secured several distribution deals, including one with the streaming service BritBox. It is expected to launch in late 2019 or early 2020.

Atkinson said of the project: "After many years of deliberation, I am delighted to announce that my new venture will be in the comedy genre. There are few things I love more than making people laugh, so this feels like a perfect move."

He added: "I am assembling a team of people who have much expertise and passion in this area, and I canâ€™t wait to get started."

The new Rowan Atkinson TV network joins an increasingly crowded field of comedy channels, including Comedy Central, BBC Three, and Viceland. However, with Atkinson's high profile and track record in the genre, it is likely to be successful.

Fans of the comedic actor took to social media to express their sadness at the news of his retirement.

"Rowan Atkinson is retiring?! Noooooooo!" one person wrote on Twitter. "He was one of my favorite actors growing up -- brought lots of laughs into my life."
