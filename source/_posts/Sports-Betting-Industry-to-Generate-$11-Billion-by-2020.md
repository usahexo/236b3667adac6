#  Sports Betting Boom Good News for Casinos and States

State and local governments have long looked at casino gambling as a way to generate revenue, and the growth of sports betting is providing a new boom for the industry.

Last year, legalized sports betting brought in $4.7 billion in revenue, up from $2.8 billion in 2017, according to a report from research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC. The firm projects that revenue will grow to $12.4 billion by 2023.

As more states legalize sports betting, casinos are seeing an increase in visitors and revenue. In Pennsylvania, where sports betting was legalized last year, casino revenue increased by 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year.

States are benefiting from taxes on gambling revenue, as well as income from licensing fees charged to casinos and bookmakers. In New Jersey, for example, sports betting accounted for more than 5 percent of state tax revenue in the first quarter of this year.

Casinos are also hiring more people to take bets and manage their sportsbooks. MGM Resorts International has plans to hire 3,000 people for its new sportsbook operation in Las Vegas.

The growth of sports betting is good news for the casino industry and state governments that rely on gambling revenue for funding

#  Sports Betting Craze Could be a Boon for Online Gambling Sites

Sports betting is becoming more and more popular as people search for ways to make watching sports more exciting. In the past, sports bets were typically placed with a bookie, but in recent years there has been a huge surge in online gambling sites that allow people to bet on sports.

There are a lot of reasons why online gambling sites are becoming more popular, but one of the main reasons is that they offer much better odds than bookies. This is because online gambling sites have less overhead costs than traditional bookies, so they can afford to offer better odds to their customers.

Another reason why online gambling sites are becoming more popular is because they offer a wider variety of betting options than traditional bookies. For example, you can usually bet on things like how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw, or how many yards a running back will gain. This gives you a lot more flexibility when it comes to making your bets.

Online gambling sites are also becoming more popular because they offer bonus offers and other incentives to their customers. For example, some sites will give you free bets if you sign up for an account. This allows you to try out the site without risking any of your own money.

Overall, the trend towards online gambling looks like it is here to stay. If you are interested in betting on sports, then be sure to check out some of the leading online gambling sites to see what they have to offer. You may be surprised at just how much variety and flexibility they offer compared to traditional bookies.

#  Sports Bettors Say Goodbye to Vegas, Hello to Oxbet

A new era in sports betting is dawning, and it’s happening without Las Vegas.

After a long and protracted legal battle, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing individual states to legalize sports betting. This has led to a flurry of activity among state legislatures, as they race to get sports betting up and running before the start of the NFL season.

One state that has already made significant headway is New Jersey. In addition to being one of the states that brought the lawsuit to the Supreme Court, New Jersey has also moved quickly to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for sports betting. As a result, there are already several licensed sportsbooks operating in the state, with more on the way.

One of the leading online sportsbooks in New Jersey is Oxbet. Oxbet offers a wide range of betting options, including traditional pre-match and in-play bets, as well as props and futures. They also offer a comprehensive selection of markets for major sporting events, including NFL, NBA, MLB, and international soccer matches.

What really sets Oxbet apart is their commitment to customer service. They have a team of experienced customer service representatives who are available 24/7 via live chat, email, or telephone. They’re always happy to help with any questions or concerns you may have about betting or your account.
