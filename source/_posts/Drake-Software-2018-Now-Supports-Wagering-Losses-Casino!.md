#  Drake Software 2018 Updated With Wagering Losses Casino Reporting!

Drake Software, the recognized top developers of innovative casino management and player tracking software, have just released an update to their popular Drake Casino product. The new version includes Wagering Losses Casino Reporting which provides a detailed report of all losses incurred by players at the casino. This is a valuable tool for casinos who want to track problem gambling behavior as well as for marketing research and analysis.

The Wagering Losses Casino Reporting in Drake Casino is part of the recently revised “Revenue” module and gives users the ability to view data on all casino games, including slots, table games, video poker and keno. Detailed information is available including game name, denomination played, amount wagered and amount lost across all casino properties for any date range desired.

This functionality is already proving its value for casinos who want to better understand their customer base. One casino commented that they were able to “identify several high-rolling slot players that were losing money faster than we would have liked” and were then able to take appropriate actions to limit their play. Another casino found that certain low-denomination slot games were being played more than other games, allowing them to focus their marketing efforts on those specific machines.

Drake Software Director of Products and Services, Tim Martin, commented on the new release saying “We are excited to offer our customers this innovative reporting capability. Our goal is always to provide our customers with the tools they need to improve their business performance. The Wagering Losses Casino Reporting does just that by giving casinos unprecedented insights into player behavior.”
